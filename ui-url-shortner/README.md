# URL Shortener Client

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):

   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

3. **Set up environment variables**:

   If your client requires environment variables (e.g., API base URL), create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary variables.

   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://server-url-shortner.vercel.app
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
